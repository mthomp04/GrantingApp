# **Grant Tracking Application**
## *Managing Funding Distribution to Non-Profit Organizations*

This application is a database for foundations to keep track of grants given to non-profit and charity organizations. 
It is intended for foundations that desire to keep track of grants distributed to organizations they support.

This project is of interest to me because I work for a foundation based out of Ontario. I manage a grant distribution 
process and use similar software in my work.

 - As a user, I want to be able to add an organization to the database
